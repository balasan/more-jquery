### more-jquery.js by [4real](http://4real.io) - when you don't have enough jquery...  

This plugin will call every possible jquery function on an element

## Getting started

Include more-jquery.js after jquery.js: 
```html
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="more-jquery.js"/></script>
```

Call the plugin with this command:

```js
$('element').moreJquery()
```
## Options

You're also able to use some of the options that let you customize it as you wish:


```js
$('element').moreJquery({
	dontRemove: true //for you protection the plugin doesn't call the functions that delete your element, but if you're feeling reckless, go ahead and set it to 'false' 
})
```
